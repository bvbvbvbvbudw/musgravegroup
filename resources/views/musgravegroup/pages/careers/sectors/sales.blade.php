                    <p><strong>We own 15 retail and wholesale brands, from household names like SuperValu,
                            Centra and Daybreak, to high-end Dublin food outlets Donnybrook Fair. We have
                            over 1,450 independently owned retail stores across the island of Ireland, and
                            the largest wholesale and foodservice business in Ireland. Within Musgrave, we
                            have dedicated sale and operations teams supporting these operations and our
                            retail partners to ensure our stores are successful and profitable.</strong></p>
                    <p>For example, we have sales teams across all our brands to support our retail
                        partners, while our business development managers play a key role in driving our
                        wholesale division and foodservice business. Our fresh food advisors work with
                        retailers and store managers to optimise sales and margins, support best practice in

                                    on-the-go coffee brand. Frank and Honest experienced rapid growth,
                                    becoming brand leader just two-years after it was launched, and there
                                    are now over 700 SuperValu and Centra stores offering Frank and Honest
                                    coffee across the island of Ireland. This summer we opened the first
                                    Frank And Honest Gourmet Coffee Company stand-alone café, located on
                                    Navan Road, Dunboyne, Co.Meath.</p>
